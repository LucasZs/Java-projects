MOVIES

My first Java project is an application, which can handle (manually inserted) basic informations about movies, especially the cast of feature films. The application is able to export the structured information into XML format. The file 'description_and_schema.jpg' contains the data structure and other details of the task. The file 'movies - given sample xml file.xml' was given as a help to reach the right data structure with exporting, but the other two sample files ('sample_movie.xml' and 'sample_person.xml') is made by myself, with this application.

MOVIES v2

My second Java project is an other version of the previous (Movies) application, which doesn't contain XML handling, but it can describe two operations (buying, lending), and uses not only movies: the new product types are the books and the games. It handles any data of the customers too. All of the operations become an unique id. This task helps me to practicle my fresh knowledges about abstract methods, abstract classes, 'implements' and 'extends' keywords, 'instanceof' operator, overriding methods and casting types. The details of the task are in file 'task-description.png'.

MOVIES v3

Serialization and networking of movies v2 application. The details of the task are in file 'task_description.png'.
